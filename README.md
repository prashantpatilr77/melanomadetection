## General Information
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Conclusions
for intial model - 
It appears that the model is overfitting consdering the patter of accuracy and error loss. 
-augumentation strategy of train dataset  being flipped, rotated and zoom - overfitting was reduced though accuracy was lower. he accuracy needs to be increased further say tuning hyperparameters, adding more layer.
With rebalancing the samples, the accuracy increased and reduction in error loss . Model did not seem to overfit looking at validation results.
